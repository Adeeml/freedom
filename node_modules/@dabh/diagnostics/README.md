# `diagnostics`

Diagnostics in the evolution of debug pattern that is used in the Node.js core,  
this extremely small but powerful technique can best be compared as feature
flags for loggers. The created debug logger is disabled by default but can be
enabled without changing a line of code, using flags.

- Allows debugging in multiple JavaScript environments such as Node.js, browsers
  and React-Native.
- Separated development and production builds to minimize impact on your
  application when bundled.
- Allows for customization of logger, messages, and much more.

### Introduction

To create a new logger simply `require` the `@dabh/diagnostics` module and call
the returned function. It accepts 2 arguments:

1. `namespace` **Required** This is the namespace of your logger so we know if we need to
   enable your logger when a debug flag is used. Generally you use the name of
   your library or application as first root namespace. For example if you're
   building a parser in a library (example) you would set namespace
   `example:parser`.
2. `options` An object with additional configur
